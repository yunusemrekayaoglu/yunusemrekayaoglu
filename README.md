### <div align="center">Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Yunus Emre!</div>  

My name is Yunus Emre, I am 22 years old, and I graduated from **Karadeniz Technical University** with a degree in **Statistics and Computer Science**. Since I was young, being involved with computers has increased my interest in software and data science.

I have intermediate knowledge of Python, which I have used to gain experience in data analysis and modeling projects. I have developed various projects involving data cleaning, visualization, and analysis, and through these projects, I have gained valuable insights.

In the field of data science, I believe I have a strong foundation in statistical methods and algorithms. I have actively worked on understanding data sets, developing meaningful modeling techniques, and applying these models to real-world problems. I also contribute to effectively presenting data by using data visualization tools and techniques.

In the future, I want to deepen my knowledge and skills in data science and analytics, and develop data-driven strategies and innovative solutions in this field.

## Current Position

I am currently working as a **Data Science Intern**, where I am actively involved in various projects that enhance my skills and knowledge in the field. This internship has provided me with hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of data science processes.

### Responsibilities and Learning

As a data science intern, I have been involved in:

- **Data Collection and Cleaning**: Gathering datasets from various sources, cleaning and preprocessing the data to ensure accuracy and completeness for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performing EDA to identify patterns, trends, and insights within the data using statistical techniques and visualization tools.
- **Model Development**: Assisting in developing machine learning models to solve real-world problems, including regression and classification tasks.
- **Collaboration**: Working closely with data scientists and other team members to contribute to team projects and share knowledge. This collaboration has enriched my understanding of practical data science applications.
